# VINCULUM
We are one. Yet we are different, Bound only by our separation. What is the purpose of it all?

## IN DEVELOPMENT
I have no clue if this will be finished or when it will be finished. This will be my first mod if completed.

### SETUP
For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.



## License

This mod is under the MIT license. Little bird flew into my window and told me that I should use this one. 
"It's fair and reasonable" I decided to trust the bird, as I am not familiar with licensing.
